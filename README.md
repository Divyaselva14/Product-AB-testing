# Product-AB-testing
## A/B Testing of New CTA Button Feature
### Objective
To assess the impact of a new call-to-action (CTA) button feature on user engagement for an EdTech platform. Specifically, we aim to determine whether the new button significantly improves click-through rates compared to the existing button.

# Methodology
### Experiment Design:
Control Group: Users who interacted with the existing CTA button.
Experimental Group: Users who interacted with the new CTA button.

### Data Collection:
We collected click data from users exposed to both the control and experimental buttons over a defined period.

### Statistical Analysis:
Analyzed the total number of clicks and the click-through rates for both groups.
Conducted a statistical test to compare the click-through rates and determine if observed differences are significant.

### Significance Testing:
Assessed the statistical significance of the difference in click-through rates using a standard hypothesis test.

### Practical Significance:
Evaluated whether the observed difference meets the minimum detectable effect (MDE) considered meaningful for practical application.

## Key Findings
### Click-Through Rates:
The new CTA button achieved a higher click-through rate compared to the existing button.
### Statistical Significance:
The difference in click-through rates between the control and experimental groups is statistically significant. This indicates that the observed improvement is unlikely to be due to random chance.
### Practical Significance:
The improvement in click-through rate meets the minimum detectable effect threshold, suggesting that the new CTA button has a meaningful impact on user engagement.

## Recommendations
### Implement the New CTA Button:
Given the significant and practically meaningful improvement in click-through rates, we recommend rolling out the new CTA button across the platform.

### Monitor Performance:
Continue to monitor user engagement metrics to ensure the new button maintains its effectiveness over time.

### Explore Further Enhancements:
Consider additional A/B tests to optimize other elements of the platform based on user feedback and engagement data.
